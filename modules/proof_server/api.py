"""proof_server — stable public API.

The proof server's job is to turn (a) a public scrubbed compute ledger and
(b) signed Merkle attestation(s) over that ledger into a zero-knowledge
proof that every published row is backed by a valid signed Merkle leaf,
without revealing the signatures.

This module is the Python facade: it builds the ledger commitment,
assembles the SP1 witness, and the consumers (``demos/proof-server/servers/proof_server.py``,
``demos/proof-server/scripts/audit.py``) shell out to the host binary in
``modules/proof_server/sp1/host/``. The host binary runs the SP1
prover / executor.

See ``demos/proof-server/plan.md`` for the v0 design.
