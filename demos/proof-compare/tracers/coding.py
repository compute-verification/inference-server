"""Coding-agent tracer (STUB) — at FORWARD-PASS granularity.

Structurally identical to the inference tracer: every node is exactly one
forward pass — one ``prefill`` (reads a batch of tokens) or one ``decode``
(emits one token). A coding agent just alternates LLM turns with tool calls:

  * A tool call (search / fetch / run-tests) runs **no model forward pass**, so
    it is NOT a node. The tokens it returns are read by the NEXT turn's prefill
    (recorded in that prefill's ``payload.via``).
  * Each turn contributes one ``prefill`` over the tokens newly added to context
    this turn (the prompt for turn 0; a tool's output thereafter) followed by one
    ``decode`` per generated token.

So the whole run is a single chain — the same shape as plain inference, just
with periodic prefill "jumps" where tool output is ingested. STUB: the token
counts are estimates from a real "summarize a paper, then implement it" run
(demos/coding-agent); the real tracer (Task 13) plugs in measured counts. The
*shape* and FLOPs accounting (attention included via the growing context) are
already correct.
