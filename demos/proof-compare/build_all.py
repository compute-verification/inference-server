"""Build all four canonical task graphs and emit them as JSON for the viz.

Each scenario's tracer -> a canonical trace -> build_graph -> a Graph dict.
We collect {inference, spec, training, coding} and write them to BOTH
traces/graphs.json (the canonical artifact) and viz/public/graphs.json, which the
React Flow app (demos/proof-compare/viz) fetches at runtime. No HTML is baked --
the frontend is a real Vite app now, not a single hand-edited file.

Run:  python3 demos/proof-compare/build_all.py
